## Installation
Before installing the Remote File Universal Orchestrator extension, it's recommended to install [kfutil](https://github.com/Keyfactor/kfutil). Kfutil is a command-line tool that simplifies the process of creating store types, installing extensions, and instantiating certificate stores in Keyfactor Command.

The Remote File Universal Orchestrator extension implements 6 Certificate Store Types. Depending on your use case, you may elect to install one, or all of these Certificate Store Types. An overview for each type is linked below:
* [RFJKS](docs/rfjks.md)
* [RFPEM](docs/rfpem.md)
* [RFPkcs12](docs/rfpkcs12.md)
* [RFDER](docs/rfder.md)
* [RFKDB](docs/rfkdb.md)
* [RFORA](docs/rfora.md)
