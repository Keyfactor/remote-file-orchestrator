1. The Remote File Orchestrator Extension makes use of a few common Linux commands when managing stores on Linux servers. If the credentials you will be connecting with need elevated access to run these commands or to access the certificate store files these commands operate against, you must set up the user id as a sudoer with no password necessary and set the config.json "UseSudo" value to "Y".  When RemoteFile is using orchestration, managing local or external certificate stores using SSH or WinRM, the security context is determined by the user id entered in the Keyfactor Command certificate store or discovery job screens.  When RemoteFile is running as an agent, managing local stores only, the security context is the user id running the Keyfactor Command Universal Orchestrator service account.  The full list of these commands below:

|Shell Command|Used For|
|---|---|
|echo|Used to append a newline and terminate all commands sent.|
|find|Used by Discovery jobs to locate potential certificate stores on the file system.|
|cp|Used by Inventory and Management Add/Remove jobs to copy the certificate store file to a temporary file (only when an alternate download folder has been configured).|
|chown|Used by the Inventory and Management Add/Remove jobs to set the permissions on the temporary file (only when an alternate download folder has been configured).|
|tee|Used by Management Add/Remove jobs to copy the temporary uploaded certificate file to the certificate store file (only when an alternate upload folder has been configured).|
|rm|Used by Inventory and Management Add/Remove jobs to remove temporary files (only when an alternate upload/download folder has been configured).|
|install|Used by the Management Create Store job when initializing a certificate store file.|
|orapki|Oracle Wallet CLI utility used by Inventory and Management Add/Remove jobs to manipulate an Oracle Wallet certificate store.  Used for the RFORA store type only.|
|gskcapicmd|IBM Key Database CLI utility used by Inventory and Management Add/Remove jobs to manipulate an IBM Key Database certificate store.  Used for the RFKDB store type only.|  

2. When orchestrating management of local or external certificate stores, the Remote File Orchestrator Extension makes use of SFTP and/or SCP to transfer files to and from the orchestrated server.  SFTP/SCP cannot make use of sudo, so all folders containing certificate stores will need to allow SFTP/SCP file transfer for the user assigned to the certificate store/discovery job.  If this is not possible, set the values in the config.json apprpriately to use an alternative upload/download folder that does allow SFTP/SCP file transfer.  If the certificate store/discovery job is configured for local (agent) access, the account running the Keyfactor Universal Orchestrator service must have access to read/write to the certificate store location, OR the config.json file must be set up to use the alternative upload/download file.  

3. SSH Authentication: When creating a Keyfactor certificate store for the remote file orchestrator extension, you may supply either a user id and password for the certificate store credentials (directly or through one of Keyfactor Command's PAM integrations), or supply a user id and SSH private key.  When using a password, the connection is attempted using SSH Password Authentication.  If that fails, Keyboard Interactive Authentication is automatically attempted.  One or both of these must be enabled on the Linux box being managed.  If private key authentication is desired, copy and paste the full SSH private key into the Password textbox (or pointer to the private key if using a PAM provider).  Please note that SSH Private Key Authentication is not available when running locally as an agent.  The following private key formats are supported: 
- PKCS#1 (BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY) 
- PKCS#8 (BEGIN PRIVATE KEY)
- ECDSA OPENSSH (BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY)   

Please reference [Configuration File Setup](#configuration-file-setup) for more information on setting up the config.json file and [Certificate Stores and Discovery Jobs](#certificate-stores-and-discovery-jobs) for more information on the items above.

1. When orchestrating management of external (and potentially local) certificate stores, the RemoteFile Orchestrator Extension makes use of WinRM to connect to external certificate store servers.  The security context used is the user id entered in the Keyfactor Command certificate store or discovery job screen.  Make sure that WinRM is set up on the orchestrated server and that the WinRM port (by convention, 5585 for HTTP and 5586 for HTTPS) is part of the certificate store path when setting up your certificate stores/discovery jobs.  If running as an agent, managing local certificate stores, local commands are run under the security context of the user account running the Keyfactor Universal Orchestrator Service.  Please reference [Certificate Stores and Discovery Jobs](#certificate-stores-and-discovery-jobs) for more information on creating certificate stores for the RemoteFile Orchestrator Extension.
