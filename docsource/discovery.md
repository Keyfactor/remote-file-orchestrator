When scheduling discovery jobs in Keyfactor Command, there are a few fields that are important to highlight here:  

<details>
<summary>Client Machine</summary>

The IP address or DNS of the server hosting the certificate store.  For more information, see [Client Machine ](#client-machine-instructions)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Store Path</summary>

For Linux orchestrated servers, "StorePath" will begin with a forward slash (/) and contain the full path and file name, including file extension if one exists (i.e. /folder/path/storename.ext).  For Windows orchestrated servers, it should be the full path and file name, including file extension if one exists, beginning with a drive letter (i.e. c:\folder\path\storename.ext).  

</details>

<details>
<summary>Server Username/Password</summary>

A username and password (or valid PAM key if the username and/or password is stored in a KF Command configured PAM integration).  The password can be an SSH private key if connecting via SSH to a server using SSH private key authentication.  If acting as an *agent* using local file access, just check "No Value" for the username and password.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Directories to Search</summary>

Enter one or more comma delimitted file paths to search (please reference the Keyfactor Command Reference Guide for more information), but there is also a special value that can be used on Windows orchestrated servers instead - "fullscan".  Entering fullscan in this field will tell the RemoteFile discovery job to search all available drive letters at the root and recursively search all of them for files matching the other search criteria.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Extensions</summary>

In addition to entering one or more comma delimitted extensions to search for (please reference the Keyfactor Command Reference Guide for more information), a reserved value of "noext" can be used that will cause the RemoteFile discovery job to search for files that do not have an extension.  This value can be chained with other extensions using the comma delimiter.  For example, entering pem,jks,noext will cause the RemoteFile discovery job to return file locations with extensions of "pem", "jks", *and* files that do not have extensions.
